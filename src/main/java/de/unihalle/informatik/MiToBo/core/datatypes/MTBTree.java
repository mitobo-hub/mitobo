 * This class implements a simple tree data structure.

 * number of children. The tree structure is implicitly given by the recursive
 * (one-way) linkage of nodes to their children.
 * 
 * Each node of the tree is associated with a certain data object. Each data
 * object has to be derived from class 'TreeNodeData' to enable one of the basic
 * features of this tree - the recursive printing of data contained within the
 * tree.
